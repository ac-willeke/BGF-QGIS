# BGF-QGIS-3.x
This repository contains a QGIS 3.x template for mapping Blue-Green Structure Typologies and calculating the Blue-Green Factor (BGF) according to BGF Oslo 2023 and BGF Standard Norge 2020. In addition, costs for production and maintenance can be calculated. 

## Usage

Read the [documentation](https://ninanor.github.io/EAguide/data-collection/field-surveys/qfield-bgf.html) for a detailed guide on how to use the BGF-QGIS template.

This template is designed to be used within Desktop QGIS v.3.x. It is not recommended to use this template inside QField, as it is not optimized for mobile devices.

## Acknowledgments

This template is adapted from **BGF-QGIS** repository, developed and published by Peter Horvath (UiO Natural History Museum). We express our gratitude to Peter and all contributors to the original template for their foundational work. The original QGIS Template for use in QGIS v.2.x can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/peterhor/BGF-QGIS).
