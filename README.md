# BGF-QGIS

The blue-green factor (BGF) is a rapid assessment tool to help quantify minimum municipal requirements for surface water management, vegetation qualities and biodiversity in outdoor areas of property developments.   BGF-QGIS makes it possible to calculate the blue-green factor for larger areas than in the original Excel-based methodology, by taking advantage of remote sensing data, GIS datasets, and CAD-based design proposals. It also provides a flexible platform for adjusting the scoring of blue-green qualities to suit specific local conditions and priorities.
