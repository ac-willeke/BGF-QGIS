A1;1;A1   Open permanent water surface that can receive rainwater;Permanent water surface supplied rainwater from the site, regardless of whether this is a channel with concrete bottom stream with green banks or other type of water surface. Only the water surface is considered
A2;0.3;A2   Partially permeable serface like gravel, crushed stone, and reinforced grass surface;Hard surfaces with permeability, providing infiltration. For example, grassy areas reinforced with concrete, gravel or crushed stone. Not surfaces of underlying hard covers if the soil depth is less than 80 cm.
A3;0.2;A3   Impermeable surfaces with drainage to vegetated areas or an open drainage magazine;Eg. concrete, asphalt, roofs and paving stones. Calculated for the area corresponding to the size of the vegetation surface that accepts water. The drainage magazine must have the capacity according to municipal requirements for discharges to official sewer system (ie it holds about 20 to 30 l / m² runoff area)
A4;0.1;A4   Impermeable surfaces with drainage to a local closed storm water drainage;Eg. concrete, asphalt, roof surfaces with runoff led to a closed facility for retention and purification of the water. This also applies to underground solutions combined with irrigation of trees. The whole area counts assuming drainage magazine is according to municipal requirements for discharges to off. sewer system (ie it holds about 20 to 30 l / m² runoff area). 
A5;1;A5   Surfaces with vegetation associated with soil or bedrock;Vegetation growing in  soil and has contact with the soil below. Beneficial for the development of flora and fauna and storm water can be pulled down to ground water. The point also applies to natural rock outcrops and cliffs.
A6;0.8;A6   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil > 80 cm;Vegetation growing in soil on minnimum 80 cm depth, but not in contact with the earth / ground below, eg. on top of a garage or roof. The depth is great enough that larger trees can grow.
A7;0.6;A7   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 40 - 80 cm;As above, but with 40-80 cm ear so that hedges, large bushes and small or medium trees can grow.
A8;0.4;A8   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 20 - 40 cm;As above, but with 20-40 cm earth for that  perennials and small bushes can grow.
A9;0.2;A9   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 5 -20 cm;As above, but with 5 - 20 cm earth that is enough for grasses, herbaceous plants and other ground cover can grow.
