BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A1;OPW;Open permanent water;A1   Open permanent water surface that can receive rainwater;Permanent water surface supplied rainwater from the site, regardless of whether this is a channel with concrete bottom stream with green banks or other type of water surface. Only the water surface is considered;1
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A2;PP;Partially permeable;A2   Partially permeable serface like gravel, crushed stone, and reinforced grass surface;Hard surfaces with permeability, providing infiltration. For example, grassy areas reinforced with concrete, gravel or crushed stone. Not surfaces of underlying hard covers if the soil depth is less than 80 cm.;0.3
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A3;IOD;Impermeable open drainage;A3   Impermeable surfaces with drainage to vegetated areas or an open drainage magazine;Eg. concrete, asphalt, roofs and paving stones. Calculated for the area corresponding to the size of the vegetation surface that accepts water. The drainage magazine must have the capacity according to municipal requirements for discharges to official sewer system (ie it holds about 20 to 30 l / m² runoff area);0.2
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A4;ICD;Impermeable closed drainage;A4   Impermeable surfaces with drainage to a local closed storm water drainage;Eg. concrete, asphalt, roof surfaces with runoff led to a closed facility for retention and purification of the water. This also applies to underground solutions combined with irrigation of trees. The whole area counts assuming drainage magazine is according to municipal requirements for discharges to off. sewer system (ie it holds about 20 to 30 l / m² runoff area). ;0.1
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A5;DGW;Drainage to groundwater;A5   Surfaces with vegetation associated with soil or bedrock;Vegetation growing in  soil and has contact with the soil below. Beneficial for the development of flora and fauna and storm water can be pulled down to ground water. The point also applies to natural rock outcrops and cliffs.;1
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A6;VS80;Vegetation+soil > 80 cm;A6   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil > 80 cm;Vegetation growing in soil on minnimum 80 cm depth, but not in contact with the earth / ground below, eg. on top of a garage or roof. The depth is great enough that larger trees can grow.;0.8
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A7;VS40-80;Vegetation+soil 40-80 cm;A7   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 40 - 80 cm;Vegetation growing in soil with 40-80 cm earth so that hedges, large bushes and small or medium trees can grow.;0.6
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A8;VS20-40;Vegetation+soil 20-40 cm;A8   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 20 - 40 cm;Vegetation growing in soil with 20-40 cm earth for that  perennials and small bushes can grow.;0.4
BGF1;Blue-Green Surfaces;A;Blue-Green Surfaces;A9;VS5-20;Vegetation+soil 5-20 cm;A9   Surfaces with vegetation, not associated with soil 5 -20 cm;Vegetation growing in soil with 5 - 20 cm earth that is enough for grasses, herbaceous plants and other ground cover can grow. ;0.2
BGF2;Additional Qualities;B;Blue additional qualities;B1;NWE;Natural water edge;B1   Natural edges to water srufaces;Water surfaces that are counted above, can also be counted in this category there is access for flora / fauna at  ground level to a natural substrate and edge (riparian) zone. Eg: stream, canal and pond with green edges The area to be considered is the width of the water surface.;0.3
BGF2;Additional Qualities;B;Blue additional qualities;B2;RB;Rain bed;B2   Rain bed or equivalent;Vegetation area that serves as rain bed or similar planted infiltration that collects, diffuses and infiltrates rainwater into the soil / ground. This does not apply to permanent water surfaces and diffusion basin counted in blue surfaces above.;0.3
BGF2;Additional Qualities;C;Green additional qualities - trees (filled in as a number);C1;CCT;Closed canopy trees;C1   Closed canopy trees (% of total area);Total area of closed tree canopy.  Factor: closed_canopy_area m2/total_locality_area (x 1).;1
BGF2;Additional Qualities;D;Green additional qualities - other (filled in as a m^2);D1;NV;Native vegetaion;D1   Native vegetaion;Establishing or protection of surfaces with a large content of valuable plant species that are a part of the local, historical natural and cultural landscape.;0.6
BGF2;Additional Qualities;D;Green additional qualities - other (filled in as a m^2);D2;HB;Hedges, bushes;D2   Hedges, bushes and multi-stemmed trees;Hedges, bushes and multi-stemmed trees with a height over 3 m. Calculated for a maximal area corresponding to the drip zone of (crown of the tree) m2/tree.;0.4
BGF2;Additional Qualities;D;Green additional qualities - other (filled in as a m^2);D3;GW;Green walls;D3   Green walls;For climbing plants and other green walls, the factor is calculated for the wall area that can be expected to be covered over the course of 5 years (a maximum of 10 m height for climbing plants). ;0.4
BGF2;Additional Qualities;D;Green additional qualities - other (filled in as a m^2);D4;PP;Perennial vegetation;D4   Perinnials and other ground cover;Does not apply to lawn grasses;0.3
BGF2;Additional Qualities;D;Green additional qualities - other (filled in as a m^2);D5;GA;Contiguous green area;D5   Contiguous green areas over 75 m2;Contiguous green area that is larger than 75 m2, as for example large grassy lawns, pllanted areas, or others.;0.1
BGF2;Additional Qualities;E;Connectivity of structures (filled in with the number 0,05);E1;C;Connectivity;E1   Connectivity to an existing Blue-green structure.;If the blue and / or green elements in the area can be connected to the existing structure outside the area in question. The connectivity should be obvious. For example, a stream opening, a link to the existing channel or water surface, drainage, the extension of an alley or a grove, merging of several courtyards with free movement between them. This provides a general increase of 0.05 in BGF.;0.05
