# Changelog for BGF-QGIS 3.x

**Author:** Willeke A'Campo

## BGF-QGIS_2.x release (2017)

- A QField app developed by Horvath et al. (2017), which allows for the registration of BGF types in QGIS 2.x. 
- The QField app is released on GitHub: [peterhor/BGF-QGIS](https://github.com/peterhor/BGF-QGIS)
- **Documentation:** [NINA report 1445 - BGF in QGIS ](https://github.com/peterhor/BGF-QGIS/blob/master/BGF_QGIS_GitHub/DOCUMENTATION/NINA%20Report%201445%20-%20BGF%20in%20QGIS.pdf)

## BGF_QGIS_3.x release (2024)

- Updated version of the QGIS template for BGF typology mapping for use in QGIS 3.x. 
- Tested during the BGF-QGIS workshop at NINA, Oslo, september 2024.
- **Documentation:** [Local Ecosystem accounts - a technical guidebook](https://ninanor.github.io/EAguide/data-collection/field-surveys/field-surveys.html)

**Updates:**

- The QGIS project is updated to QGIS 3.x.
- All .shp and .csv are saved inside one GPKG.
- The BGF typology layer is updated to BGF Oslo 2023 and BGF Standard Norge 2020.
- The BGF typology layer is updated to include a twin point layer that is syncronised to simplify digitization in the field.
- The BGF typology layer is updated to include a cost calculation for production and maintenance.
- The BGF typology layer is updated to include an automatic BGF score calculation.
- Online basemaps are added to the project.
- BGF norm and cost calculation can be exported to a CSV file.

## Future improvements

- Create one QGIS project for mapping both BGF, NiN and Biodiveristy Metrics typologies. 
    - Note that the Biodiversity Metrics and NiN typologies are quite complex, and it might be difficult to combine them in one project.
    - Note that QGIS NiN 3.0 is not yet released, and the typologies might change.
- Add a grid layer that can be used to snap to when digitizing typologies. 
    - This grid can be used to standardize labeling of typologies for creating a benchmark dataset for training machine learning models.
    - Possible grid options: Sentinel raster, VHR raster
- Add ELC10 and Google Dynamic World as a offline and online Basemap
    - ELC10 must first be published as a WMS service. 
- Create a PDF report that shows the BGF typologies and the BGF score. 
    - This report can be used for communication with stakeholders and for documentation purposes. 
    - The report should be generated automatically when the BGF score is calculated.
- Cost module: account for spatial explicit characteristics such as land use/soil type when calculating costs. 
    - e.g. cost will be higher/lower than average for certain soil types
    - soil type maps need to be available in the project area or first manually mapped.

**Table 2.** Comparison of functionality.
| **Functionality** | BGF-QGIS-2.x | BGF-QGIS-3.x |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blue-green Structure Typology Mapping** | A polygon layer with attributes for BGF Norm 2017 is available for digitizing typologies. | A polygon layer with attributes for BGF 2023 and SN BGF 2020 is available for digitizing typologies. In addition, a twin point layer is available that is syncronised to simplify digitization in the field. |

| **BGF Norm Calculation** | Export CSV from QGIS and calculate BGF Norm 2017 in Excel. | The BGF-QGIS calculates the BGF norm and automatically updates this norm if area or attribute changes are made to the Blue-green structure typology polygons. <br><br> BGF norm is calculated for: <li>BGF Oslo 2023</li> <li>Standard Norge BGF 2020</li> <li> User-defined weights </li>|
| **BGF Cost Calculation** | Not available | The BGF-QGIS calculates the production and maintance cost per typology polygon and as total of the project area.  |
